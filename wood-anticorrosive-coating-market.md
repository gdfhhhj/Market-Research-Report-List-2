<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wood Anticorrosive Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-borne Coating</li><li>Water-borne Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wood anticorrosive coatings are used to protect wood surfaces from corrosion and decay caused by moisture, UV rays, and insects. The market includes two main types: solvent-borne coatings and water-borne coatings. Solvent-borne coatings are formulated with organic solvents that are evaporated during the drying process, leaving a protective film on the wood surface. Water-borne coatings, on the other hand, use water as the main solvent, making them less harmful to the environment and reducing the emission of toxic fumes. Both types provide effective corrosion protection for wood surfaces.</p></p>
