<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jet Dispenser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Jetting</li><li>Non-Contact Jetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Jet Dispenser market encompasses two types: Contact Jetting and Non-Contact Jetting. Contact Jetting involves the physical contact between the jet and the dispensed material, providing precise and controlled dispensing for applications such as adhesive and soldering. On the other hand, Non-Contact Jetting does not have physical contact, instead using air pressure or vibrations to propel the fluid, which is ideal for delicate materials like biomaterials and fragile electronics. Both types cater to specific industries and offer distinct advantages in terms of accuracy, speed, and compatibility with different materials.</p></p>
