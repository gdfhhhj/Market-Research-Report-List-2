<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardants for Fibres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphorous Flame Retardant</li><li>Halogen Flame Retardant</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flame retardants for fibers are additives used to reduce the flammability of textile materials. Phosphorous flame retardants work by releasing phosphorous compounds when exposed to heat, thereby inhibiting the combustion process. Halogen flame retardants contain elements like chlorine or bromine that release flame-inhibiting gases when heated. Other market types include nitrogen-based flame retardants, intumescent flame retardants, and mineral-based flame retardants. These additives function by either extinguishing the fire, forming a protective char layer, or diluting the flammable gases. Each type has its own advantages and suitability depending on the specific application and regulatory requirements.</p></p>
