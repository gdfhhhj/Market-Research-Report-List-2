<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hull Mounted Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar Type</li><li>Active Sonar Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hull-mounted sonar market comprises two types: passive sonar and active sonar. Passive sonar systems detect and analyze sounds emitted by potential targets in the water using sensitive hydrophones. This type of sonar is covert and does not emit any signals, allowing for silent tracking and monitoring of underwater activities. On the other hand, active sonar systems emit sound signals and then analyze the echoes, providing information about the location, speed, and direction of targets. Active sonar can be used for target identification, navigation, and detecting objects at longer ranges.</p></p>
