<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Phase SPE</li><li>Reversed Phase SPE</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) is a chromatographic technique used for the extraction and purification of target compounds from complex mixtures. Normal Phase SPE is used when the target compounds are more polar than the matrix, allowing for separation based on polarity differences. Reversed Phase SPE, on the other hand, is used when the target compounds are less polar than the matrix, allowing for separation based on hydrophobicity. Both techniques utilize a solid stationary phase that retains the target compounds while unwanted substances are washed away, resulting in purified samples for analysis.</p></p>
