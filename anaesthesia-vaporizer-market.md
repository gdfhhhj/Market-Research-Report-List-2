<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anaesthesia Vaporizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plenum Vaporizers</li><li>Drawover Vaporizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anaesthesia vaporizers are devices used in medical settings to administer anesthetic agents to patients during surgery or other procedures. There are two main types of anaesthesia vaporizers: plenum vaporizers and drawover vaporizers. </p><p>Plenum vaporizers are integrated into the anesthesia machine and receive a constant supply of fresh gas flow. They have a separate chamber called a plenum, where the vaporization of the anesthetic agent takes place. </p><p>Drawover vaporizers, on the other hand, are portable devices that are manually operated by the healthcare professional. They draw in fresh gas flow and pass it through an anesthetic agent, which is then inhaled by the patient.</p></p>
