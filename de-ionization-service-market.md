<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The De-Ionization Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual-Beds</li><li>Mixed-Beds</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the de-ionization service market, there are two main types of systems known as dual-beds and mixed-beds. Dual-beds consist of separate anion and cation exchange beds, where water passes through each bed to remove specific ions. This type of system is commonly used for applications that require high purity water. On the other hand, mixed-beds contain a mixture of both anion and cation exchange resins in a single vessel. This system is typically used when an even higher level of purity is required, as it ensures complete removal of all ionic impurities from the water.</p></p>
