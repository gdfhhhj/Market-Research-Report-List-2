<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow Shaft Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Hollow Shaft Encoder</li><li>Absolute Hollow Shaft Encoder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hollow Shaft Encoder Market is divided into two main types: Incremental Hollow Shaft Encoder and Absolute Hollow Shaft Encoder. Incremental Hollow Shaft Encoder provides information on the position and movement of an object by generating pulses as it rotates. It does not provide absolute position information. On the other hand, Absolute Hollow Shaft Encoder provides precise and absolute position information, so it can determine the exact position of the object without the need for a reference point. Both types of encoders are widely used in various industries for different applications.</p></p>
