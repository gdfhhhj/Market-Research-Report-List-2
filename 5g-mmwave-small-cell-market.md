<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 5G mmWave Small Cell Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Integrated Small Cell</li><li>Distributed Small Cell</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 5G mmWave small cell market comprises two main types: integrated small cells and distributed small cells. Integrated small cells are standalone devices equipped with antennas and baseband processing. They are usually mounted on utility poles or rooftops to provide localized coverage in dense urban areas. On the other hand, distributed small cells act as extensions to existing macro cells, using the same baseband processing and antennas. They are connected to a central baseband unit and are commonly deployed in outdoor environments to enhance coverage and capacity. Both types play a crucial role in expanding network connectivity and improving the overall 5G experience.</p></p>
