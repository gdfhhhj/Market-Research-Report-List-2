<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cautery Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Device</li><li>Bipolar Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cautery machines are medical devices used for precise tissue cutting or coagulation during surgical procedures. The market for cautery machines can be categorized into two types: unipolar devices and bipolar devices. Unipolar devices have a single electrode that delivers current to the surgical site and requires a grounding pad to complete the circuit. On the other hand, bipolar devices have two electrodes that are designed to operate on tissue between them, eliminating the need for a grounding pad. Both types have their advantages and are used based on the specific requirements of the surgery.</p></p>
