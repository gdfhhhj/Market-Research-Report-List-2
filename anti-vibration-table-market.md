<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-vibration Table Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Anti-vibration Table</li><li>Active Anti-vibration Table</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Anti-vibration Table market includes two major types: Passive Anti-vibration Table and Active Anti-vibration Table. Passive Anti-vibration Tables rely on isolation materials like rubber or pneumatic systems to absorb vibrations passively. They are cost-effective and easy to use but offer limited vibration control. In contrast, Active Anti-vibration Tables have built-in sensors and actuators to actively counteract vibrations. These tables can detect and respond to vibrations in real-time, providing superior vibration isolation and stability. However, they are more complex and expensive compared to passive tables.</p></p>
