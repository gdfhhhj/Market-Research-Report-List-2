<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared temperature sensors are devices used to measure the temperature of an object without making physical contact. There are two main types of infrared temperature sensors in the market: contact type and non-contact type. </p><p>Contact type sensors require direct contact with the object being measured, usually through a probe or surface attachment. These sensors provide accurate temperature readings but may be limited in terms of accessibility or practicality for certain applications.</p><p>Non-contact type sensors, on the other hand, use infrared technology to measure temperature from a distance without touching the object. They are commonly found in industries where measuring moving or hazardous objects is required. While non-contact sensors offer convenience and versatility, their measurements may be slightly less precise compared to contact type sensors due to factors like distance and environmental conditions.</p></p>
