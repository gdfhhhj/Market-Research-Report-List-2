<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Imaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MRI</li><li>CT</li><li>X-ray</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal imaging market consists of four types: MRI, CT, X-ray, and ultrasound. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the spine and surrounding tissues. CT (computed tomography) combines X-rays and computer processing to generate cross-sectional images of the spine, providing clearer visuals than traditional X-rays. X-ray uses electromagnetic radiation to reveal the bone structure and potentially detect fractures or abnormalities. Ultrasound employs sound waves to form real-time images of the spine, primarily used to evaluate soft tissues and blood flow.</p></p>
