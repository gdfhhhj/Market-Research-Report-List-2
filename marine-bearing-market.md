<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Bearing</li><li>Sliding Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The marine bearing market comprises two main types: rolling bearing and sliding bearing. Rolling bearings operate through rolling elements such as balls or rollers, which enable smooth rotation and reduce friction between moving parts. On the other hand, sliding bearings work on a sliding principle, where a lubricant separates the bearing surfaces to minimize friction and wear. Both types play a crucial role in marine applications, ensuring reliable and efficient performance of various equipment, such as propellers and shafts, in marine vessels.</p></p>
