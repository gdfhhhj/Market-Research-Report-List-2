<p><p>Orthopaedic bone cement and casting materials are key components used in orthopaedic surgeries to fix fractured bones or replace damaged ones. Bone cement is a material that is injected into the body to provide support and stability to the bone. It is commonly used in joint replacement surgeries, such as hip and knee replacements. Casting materials, on the other hand, are used to immobilize and protect fractured bones, allowing them to heal properly.</p><p>The orthopaedic bone cement and casting materials market is witnessing significant growth due to the rising prevalence of orthopaedic disorders and the increasing aging population around the world. The demand is driven by the growing number of bone fractures and joint replacement surgeries, which are expected to increase with the aging population.</p><p>Moreover, technological advancements in orthopaedic implants and materials are also propelling the market growth. Manufacturers are developing advanced bone cement and casting materials that provide better adhesion, improved strength, and reduced post-operative complications. Additionally, the increasing adoption of minimally invasive surgical procedures is further driving the market growth.</p><p>The market is also witnessing a trend towards the use of bioresorbable materials for orthopaedic surgeries. These materials are gradually absorbed by the body, eliminating the need for a second surgery for their removal. This trend is gaining popularity as it reduces the risk of infections and other complications associated with traditional orthopaedic materials.</p><p>Furthermore, the orthopaedic bone cement and casting materials market is witnessing increased collaborations and partnerships between manufacturers and healthcare institutions for product development and distribution. This is expected to drive market growth by expanding product reach and ensuring better accessibility to healthcare facilities.</p><p>In conclusion, the orthopaedic bone cement and casting materials market is projected to grow at a robust rate of 10.7% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by factors such as the growing prevalence of orthopaedic disorders, technological advancements, the adoption of minimally invasive surgical procedures, and the trend towards bioresorbable materials. The market is expected to witness further expansion through collaborations and partnerships between manufacturers and healthcare institutions.</p></p>
