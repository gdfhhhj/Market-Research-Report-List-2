<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micro Cogeneration Packages (CP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid</li><li>Off-Grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Micro Cogeneration Packages (CP) are small-scale power generating systems that simultaneously produce heat and electricity. These systems can be classified into two market types: On-Grid and Off-Grid. </p><p>On-Grid micro Cogeneration Packages are connected to the main utility grid, allowing for the excess electricity generated to be fed back into the grid and sold to the utility company. This enables consumers to offset their energy bills and potentially earn income through feed-in tariffs.</p><p>Off-Grid micro Cogeneration Packages, on the other hand, are not connected to the utility grid. These systems provide autonomy and independence from the grid, making them suitable for remote or isolated locations. Off-Grid systems typically incorporate energy storage solutions to ensure a consistent power supply when generation is low or unavailable.</p></p>
