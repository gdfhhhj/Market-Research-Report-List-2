<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Tags Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID tags are classified into two main market types: active and passive. Active RFID tags have an internal power source and actively transmit signals to a reader, allowing for longer-range communication. They are typically used in applications requiring real-time tracking or monitoring, such as in supply chain management or asset tracking. On the other hand, passive RFID tags use radio frequency energy from the reader to power themselves and communicate back. Passive tags are cost-effective and commonly used in inventory management, access control, or retail applications.</p></p>
