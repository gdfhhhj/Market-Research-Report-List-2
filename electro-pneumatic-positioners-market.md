<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electro Pneumatic Positioners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Type</li><li>Double Acting Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electro Pneumatic Positioners market consists of two main types: Single Acting Type and Double Acting Type. The Single Acting Type positioners are designed to operate in one direction only, either open or closed. They use a spring to return to their original position when the power is turned off. On the other hand, Double Acting Type positioners can operate in both directions, allowing for more flexibility in controlling the valve position. They require air pressure to move the valve both towards open and closed positions.</p></p>
