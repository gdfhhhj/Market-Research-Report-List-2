<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical biometry is a technology used in ophthalmology for measuring the various dimensions of the eye. In the contact type optical biometry market, a probe is placed in direct contact with the eye's surface to gather measurements. This method is invasive and requires patient cooperation. On the other hand, the non-contact type optical biometry market uses a non-invasive approach, where measurements are taken without the need for physical contact with the eye. This type of optical biometry is considered more convenient and comfortable for patients.</p></p>
