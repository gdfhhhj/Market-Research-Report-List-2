<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aquaculture Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li><li>Other Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aquaculture vaccine market consists of three main types: live vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and other vaccines. Live vaccines are prepared using a weakened or attenuated form of the disease-causing pathogen, stimulating an immune response without causing illness in the fish. Inactivated vaccines are created by killing the pathogen, then using its components to stimulate an immune response. Other vaccines refer to alternative vaccine types such as DNA vaccines or subunit vaccines, which use specific parts of the pathogen to induce immunity. These vaccines are crucial for preventing and controlling diseases in aquaculture animals.</p></p>
