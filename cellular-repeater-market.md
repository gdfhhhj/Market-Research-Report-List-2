<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellular Repeater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Donor Antenna</li><li>Indoor Antenna</li><li>Signal Amplifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cellular repeater market consists of three major types of products: donor antenna, indoor antenna, and signal amplifier. Donor antenna is an external antenna that captures the weak cellular signal and transfers it to the repeater. Indoor antennas are used to distribute the amplified signal throughout an indoor space. Signal amplifiers increase the strength of the captured signal to provide better coverage and connectivity. These components work together to improve cellular reception in areas with weak signal strength and ensure a reliable and seamless wireless communication experience.</p></p>
