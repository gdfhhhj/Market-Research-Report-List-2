<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Printed Human Organ Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrogel</li><li>Living Cells</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D printed human organ market can be classified into two main types: Hydrogel and Living Cells. Hydrogel-based 3D printed organs are made using a bioink composed of water-based materials, such as proteins or artificial molecules. These organs have limited functionality and are often used for temporary purposes or as a scaffold for living cells. On the other hand, 3D printed organs using living cells involve the deposition of viable cells onto a supportive structure. These organs have the potential to fully mimic the functionality of natural organs, making them more suitable for long-term use.</p></p>
