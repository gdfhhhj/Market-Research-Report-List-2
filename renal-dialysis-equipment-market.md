<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Dialysis Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The renal dialysis equipment market consists of two major types: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis involves the use of an external machine that filters waste and excess fluid from the blood, whereas peritoneal dialysis uses the body's peritoneal cavity as a natural filter. Hemodialysis machines require a dialyzer, blood tubing, and a dialysate delivery system, while peritoneal dialysis equipment involves a catheter, dialysis solution bag, and a drainage bag. Both types of equipment play a crucial role in the treatment of individuals with kidney failure.</p></p>
